    <h1>Gotchi Battler Tournament Analysis</h1>

    <div style='text-align: center;'><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
    <p>We're running all tournament battles again through multiple simulations to figure out team win rates. The number of simulations per match chosen has been n = 200.</p>
    <p>We are conducting these win rate statistics over n simulations to achieve the following objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explain Matches:</strong> Help elucidate the dynamics of matches within a given tournament.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify Statistical Upsets:</strong> Better understand what constitutes a statistically significant upset.</li>
      <li><strong>BRS Upsets:</strong> When a team has significantly higher TOTAL BRS than the opposing team, yet the opposing team has a higher win rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate Synergies:</strong> Assess how certain synergies are performing relative to expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment with Broader Simulations:</strong> Compare and contrast performance with broader simulations encompassing various types of Gotchis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given our current computational resources and cost considerations, conducting 200 simulations per match has proven to be consistent. For instance, the differences observed in a given match across multiple simulations have not exceeded 1% win rate points. For example, a team that initially had a 199-1 score against another team in the original simulations might exhibit a 200-0 or 197-3 score upon rerunning the simulations.</p>
    <p>For a <strong>BRS Upset</strong> to be detected and shown in a table, a team must have over 300 TOTAL BRS more than the opposing team, and the opposing team must have a higher win rate.</p>
    <p>For a <strong>Statistical Upset</strong>, we have determined that if over n simulations, a team has over 90% win rate versus another team, and yet loses, this constitutes an upset.</p>
    <p>There's a third table that detects cases where both teams have similar TOTAL BRS (within 50 points), yet the win rate difference is substantial (90%).</p>
    <p>It's important to detect why these are happening, if it's because of synergy, leaders, traits, general team compositions etc, as they can constitute points of imbalance.</p>
